## 📦 Installation

### Method 1: HACS (recommended)
1. In GitHub create a release with a semver tag (for example `v1.0.0`). The repository includes a `hacs.json` file so HACS can detect this as a frontend plugin.
2. In Home Assistant, open HACS → Frontend → Click the "+" button and search for "Season Indicator Card" (or add the repository manually by URL).

### Method 2: Manual install
**Step 1: Copy the file**
Copy the file `season-indicator-card.js` to:
```
/config/www/season-indicator-card.js
```
**Step 2: Add resource**
Choose one of the methods:

#### A) Via UI (easier):
1. Go to **Settings** → **Dashboards** → **Resources** tab
2. Click **"ADD RESOURCE"**
3. Enter:
   - **URL:** `/local/season-indicator-card.js`
   - **Resource type:** **JavaScript Module**
4. Click **"CREATE"**

#### B) Via configuration.yaml:
```yaml
lovelace:
  mode: storage
  resources:
    - url: /local/season-indicator-card.js
      type: module
```
**Step 3: Refresh**
Clear your browser cache (Ctrl+F5) or restart Home Assistant

## 🔧 How it works

The card computes the current day of year and displays it on a **horizontal timeline**. The timeline starts at Spring (Mar 21) so seasons appear in logical order without a break:
```
[Spring]→[Summer]→[Autumn]→[Winter]
Mar 21   Jun 21   Sep 23   Dec 21   Mar 20
```
Season breakdown:
- **Spring**: Mar 21 - Jun 20 = 92 days
- **Summer**: Jun 21 - Sep 22 = 94 days
- **Autumn**: Sep 23 - Dec 20 = 89 days
- **Winter**: Dec 21 - Mar 20 = 90 days

Example:
- **Jan 5** (day 5 of year) → **Winter** (day 16 of winter) → indicator in last quarter
- **Jul 15** (day 196 of year) → **Summer** (day 24 of summer) → indicator in second quarter

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Card does not appear:**
- Ensure the file is in `/config/www/`
- Verify the resource is added in Settings
- Clear browser cache (CTRL+F5)
- Check browser console (F12) for errors

**Error "Custom element doesn't exist":**
- Wait a moment after adding the resource
- Restart Home Assistant
- Refresh the browser with cache cleared
